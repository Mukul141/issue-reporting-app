# CityPulse — Urban Issue Reporter

⚠️ Note: This repo does not include Firebase config files.  
To run the app, you must create and link your own Firebase project (see [Setup](#setup)).

---

CityPulse lets residents report urban issues with photos and GPS location, then routes them to the right department and tracks resolution in real time.  
It’s built with Flutter and Firebase for fast development, real-time updates, and easy scaling across platforms.

---

## Highlights

- Report issues with category, description, photos, and precise geolocation.
- Real-time personal dashboard of submitted reports with live status updates.
- Smart sorting to keep “In Progress” items at the top, then “Submitted,” then “Resolved.”
- Clean, readable code with clear comments and logical module grouping.
- Ready for hackathon demos with a simple setup and extensible structure.

---

## Screenshots

- Add 3–5 screenshots or a short GIF: Login, Home (list), Create Report, Details with status chip.
- Tip: Save images in a `docs/` or `assets/screenshots/` folder and reference them here.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: UI, cross-platform, Material widgets, intl for formatting.  
- **Firebase**: Authentication, Firestore for data, Storage for images.  
- **Plugins**: `firebase_core`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_auth`, `firebase_storage`, `image_picker`, `geolocator`, `intl`.

## How It Works

- Sign in or sign up with email and password using Firebase Authentication.  
- Create a report with a category, description, photos, and auto-captured GPS coordinates.  
- The app uploads photos to Firebase Storage, writes the report to Firestore, and streams updates back to the user’s dashboard.  
- The list uses a StreamBuilder for real-time rendering and a simple priority sort for statuses.

---

## Setup

1) **Prerequisites**  
- Install Flutter SDK and set up a device/emulator.  
- Create a Firebase project from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).  
- Enable **Authentication (Email/Password)**, **Firestore Database**, and **Storage**.

2) **Link your Firebase project**  
- Run:
  ```sh
  flutterfire configure


This generates a new `lib/firebase_options.dart` tied to your Firebase project.

* Download your **`google-services.json`** (Android) and place it inside:

  ```
  android/app/google-services.json
  ```
* Download your **`GoogleService-Info.plist`** (iOS) and place it inside:

  ```
  ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
  ```

3. **Initialize Firebase in code**
   Already included in `main.dart` — nothing extra required.


4. **Permissions**

* Location and photo access permissions are already added to Android/iOS project files.  
* If you create a new Flutter project from scratch, you’ll need to add them manually.

5. **Run**

* Install dependencies:

  ```sh
  flutter pub get
  ```
* Start the app:

  ```sh
  flutter run
  ```

## Development Notes

* Keep all Firebase calls in `core/services/` for cleaner code and easier testing.
* Use `StreamBuilder` to display live report updates from Firestore.
* Dispose controllers in forms to avoid memory leaks.
* Add inline comments to explain non-obvious intent.

---

## Roadmap Ideas

* Leaderboard with points for active reporters.
* Push notifications on status changes via Firebase Cloud Messaging.
* Map view with clustered issue markers.
* Admin panel for assignments and analytics.
